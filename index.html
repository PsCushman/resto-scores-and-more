                <h2 class="text-center">Welcome to our Project!</h2>
                <p>We are David, Leo, and Payson and we made a lot of maps.</p>
                <p>For this project, we used:</p>
                <p>API and CSV to generate data, Python and Pandas to clean data, and SQL to store data and execute queries.</p>
                <p>We also used Flask and Jinja, Leaflet and its plugins, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for styling...</p>

            <section data-place="cluster">
                <h2>Starting with a Cluster Map</h2>
                <p>The first thing we did was make a cluster map. It was a nice place to begin because we had a solid example from which to jump.</p>
                <p>The scores are color coated on the markers, and we added a search control - a plugin we had not yet used.</p>
                <p>The marker here in the story map is relativley abitrary. It is the latitude and longitude of Benu, a fancy SF resturant that we used repeatedly to see if the search function worked.</p>
                <p>The Leaflet plugin did not allow for searching clustered markers, so we had to create a separate layer of invisible markers to search.</p>
                <p>You can check out both the code for the invisible markers and the map itself below.</p>

            <section  data-place="choropleth">
                <h2>Frustrated by GeoJson</h2>
                <p>SF Public Health Data we used contained scores for 809 restaurants.</p>
                <p>And not all zipcode areas were represented in city's data so we had to account for that. The marker here is set to the main post office for 94132, the zipcode with the highest avg inspection score of 90.</p>
                <p>Coordinates from inspection score json would not plot over geojson of San Francisco.</p>
                <img src="static/images/image_720.png" alt="GeoJson Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
                <p>So we had to convert inspection score json to geojson</p>
                <img src="static/images/image_721.png" alt="GeoJson2 Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

                <h2>Over the Years...</h2>
                <p>We took the database provided by the SF goverment and set up a map to filter data by the year, incident type, and score.</p>
                <p>The data provided was over the years of 2016-2019</p>
                <p>The pandemic halted inspections for awhile so there is some funky data in there and a few resturants out there that exist and have not been updated in either the database or the API</p>

            <section data-place="jumbo">
                <h2>New Jumbo Seafood and Sunflower Restaurant</h2>
                <p>We did SQL queries to find out which resturants were the worst!</p>
                <p>Over the period of provided data, New Jumbo Seafood (marked on the map) and Sunflower Restaurant had the lowest avg score at 60.5 and 63.5 respectivley. Both are still in operation today.</p>
                <p>We also used Flask to take the API data and convert it into a DataFrame. Using Python and Pandas, we extracted only the restaurants with recent incidents categorized as high-risk.</p>
                <p>First, we rendered the restaurants variable to the template:</p>
                <img src="static/images/render_to_template.png" alt="Render Image">
                <p>Then we called the Jinja variables in HTML while converting it to JSON:</p>
                <img src="static/images/html_jinja.png" alt="HTML_Jinja Image">
                <p>Lastly, we accessed the restaurants variable directly in our script as a normal variable:</p>
                <img src="static/images/js_jinja.png" alt="JS_Jinja Image">
                <p>Check it out running on localhost.</p>

            <section data-place="lees">
                <h2>The Case of Lee's Deli</h2>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="static/images/lees.png" alt="Lee's Restaurant">
                </div>
                <p>In our first SQL searches, we found that Lee's had the most high-risk incidents. However, we did not include the business ID, and because Lee's had multiple locations, it seemed worse than it was.</p>
                <p>Once we fixed this and used both the business name and business ID to filter restaurants, we found that Lee's had 4 locations, with an average score of approximately 83.9.</p>
                <p>We still had an issue when accounting for incident counts once we added business IDs.</p>
                <p>For instance, Taqueria Cancun, where one of us used to eat a lot circa 2008, had 6 incidents, but it also had the most inspections of any non-school over the period. Once we adjusted for incidents per inspection date, we found that there was only one recorded incident per visit for every foodservice establishment.</p>

            <section  data-place="schools">
                <h2>Schools</h2>
                <p>Look, school is important but it doesn't necessarly have the best repuation for good food.</p>
                <p>It may not be good, but it is safe.</p>
                <p>We found that out of the 379 spots with good inpections (with 2 or more inspections with an avg score over 92), 49 were schools.</p>
                <p>Our queries found that Francisco Middle School with an avg score of 96.4 did the best and is marked on our story map.<p>
                <p>In case you are wondering, Tenderloin Elementry did the worst with an avg score of 89.4.</p>

            <section data-place="storymap">
                <h2>Bringing it All Back Home</h2>
                <p>This project and the presentation are entirely contained within our story map, GitHub Pages, and a localhost using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.</p>
                <p>There were a few bugs when we attempted to download the plugin from GitHub, but by saving the webpage directly and then working backwards, loading scripts and playing with the CSS, we got it to work.</p>
                <p>A map to present maps felt fitting.</p>
